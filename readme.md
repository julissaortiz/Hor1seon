## Description

As a marketing agency, Horiseon, has extended their access abilities by having a website that makes it easier to access certain parts of their websites.

## Usage

I started by including the starter code from urban-octo-telegram.
Then I made the website easier accessible by being able to click on a tab you would like to know more about from the top and it will bring you to that exact spot that will give you more information about the topic you wanted to know more about.
